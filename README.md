## ▶️ How to Run the Project

1. **Double-click** on the file `login.html`  
   → This will open it in your web browser.

2. **Login** using:
   - Username: `admin`
   - Password: `1234`

3. You’ll be redirected to the **main app** (`index.html`) automatically.

> ℹ️ You must always start from `login.html`. Do **not** open `index.html` directly — it checks your login status and will redirect you back.
